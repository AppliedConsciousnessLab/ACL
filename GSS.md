# Global Safety Standards (GSS)

## Purpose

The Global Safety Standards (GSS) define the minimum conditions required for healthy human functioning in individuals, groups, and systems.

Safety is treated as a prerequisite, not an outcome.

No system—biological, psychological, social, or technological—can perform, adapt, or evolve sustainably without first meeting baseline safety conditions.

## Definition of Safety

Safety is the sustained condition in which a human nervous system can operate without persistent threat, coercion, deprivation, or destabilization.

Safety is not comfort.
Safety is not agreement.
Safety is not control.

Safety is the absence of chronic threat to:
- Physical integrity
- Emotional stability
- Cognitive coherence
- Social belonging
- Meaning and agency

---

## Why Safety Comes First

When safety is compromised, systems do not fail randomly.

They degrade predictably.

Under unsafety:
- Cognitive bandwidth narrows
- Threat responses dominate behavior
- Truth perception distorts
- Long-term planning collapses
- Recovery capacity diminishes

Performance, intelligence, morality, and innovation all decline downstream of unsafety.

Any framework that attempts optimization without first restoring safety is operating on borrowed time.

## Failure Dynamics

GSS recognizes failure not as moral weakness, but as a mechanical response to unsafe conditions.

Common failure modes include:
- Fight / flight / freeze dominance
- Polarization and scapegoating
- Burnout and learned helplessness
- Rigid ideology or nihilism
- Systemic brittleness

These outcomes are signals, not sins.

---

## Scope

GSS applies to:
- Individuals
- Families
- Organizations
- Communities
- Institutions
- Nations
- Digital and AI-mediated systems

The standards are scale-invariant.

---

## Status

GSS is an open, evolving standard maintained by the Applied Consciousness Lab (ACL).

It is:
- Public
- Non-proprietary
- Non-political
- Non-religious
- Free to reference and adapt

Safety is not owned.
Safety is infrastructure.

---

## Boundary Conditions

GSS does not prescribe ideology, belief, or governance models.

It defines prerequisites only.

What humans build on top of safety is a separate question.
