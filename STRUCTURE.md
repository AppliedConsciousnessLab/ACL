# ACL Repository Structure

This repository contains the public, open materials of the **Applied Consciousness Lab (ACL)**.  
Its purpose is to define, preserve, and distribute foundational frameworks related to safety, coherence, and system dynamics in human, organizational, and civilizational contexts.

ACL is intentionally structured to be:
- Readable by non-specialists
- Citable by institutions
- Stable over time
- Independent of any single author, platform, or personality

---

## Core Documents

### 1. README.md
**Purpose:** Public orientation

The README provides a high-level overview of:
- What ACL is
- Why it exists
- How its materials should be interpreted and used

This file is intended for first-time readers, collaborators, and institutions evaluating the repository.

---

### 2. PREFACE.md
**Purpose:** Context and intent

The Preface explains:
- Why the work was created
- Why contributors are anonymous at this stage
- The guiding motivation behind prioritizing safety and coherence

This document sets ethical and philosophical context without asserting authority or ideology.

---

### 3. GSS.md — Global Safety Standards
**Purpose:** Foundational safety framework

GSS defines:
- Safety as a primary prerequisite for functioning systems
- Failure dynamics when safety is absent
- Shared principles that apply across domains (individual, organizational, societal)

GSS is designed to stand alone and to be referenced by external works, policies, and institutions.

---

### 4. EP.md — Emotional Physics
**Purpose:** Mechanism-level explanation

EP provides:
- A descriptive model for how emotional and cognitive states propagate through systems
- Language for coherence, instability, and feedback loops
- A bridge between subjective experience and observable system behavior

EP complements GSS but is not dependent on it. Each may be used independently or together.

## Design Principles

ACL materials follow these constraints:

- **Open access:** Freely available for reading, sharing, and reference
- **Non-proprietary:** No platform, tool, or organization is required to use the ideas
- **Non-performative:** The work stands on its content, not its authorship
- **Stability-first:** Frameworks are intentionally conservative to reduce churn

---

## Relationship to Other Works

ACL frameworks may be:
- Referenced by books, courses, policies, or software
- Used as educational or institutional baselines
- Integrated into other systems without modification

ACL does not depend on any commercial product or ecosystem.  
Commercial works may reference ACL, but ACL remains neutral and standalone.

---

## Future Additions

Additional documents may be added over time, but only if they:
- Preserve backward compatibility
- Do not invalidate existing frameworks
- Improve clarity rather than expand scope

Any future expansions will prioritize safety, coherence, and interpretability.

---

## Licensing

All materials in this repository are released under an open Creative Commons license, intended to maximize public benefit and long-term accessibility.

No permission is required to read, share, or reference this work.
