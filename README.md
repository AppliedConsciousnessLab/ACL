## GSS by ACL — Canonical Safety Framework

This book and its teachings are aligned with the **Global Safety Standard (GSS by Applied Consciousness Lab)**.

The living constitutional source of truth for all safety doctrine, appendices, and governance is:

The Applied Consciousness Lab (ACL) is an open, public initiative dedicated to the study, standardization, and repair of safety, truth, and coherence in human systems.

ACL maintains two primary bodies of work:

- **GSS — Global Safety Standards**  
  Open, non-negotiable standards defining when systems are structurally safe and valid.

- **EP — Emotional Physics**  
  A descriptive and corrective framework examining how emotional energy behaves in human systems, especially under unsafe conditions, and how recovery becomes possible.

ACL is not a commercial venture.  
All materials are published openly to support individuals, communities, institutions, and societies in building safer, more coherent systems.

The goal is simple:  
to provide civilization-scale tools for safety, diagnosis, and repair that stand on their own merit.
